<h1> EasyPartials </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

<p>
  EasyPartials are a way to make partials in Rails even easier!  This
  is an expansion of a <a href="http://smellsblue.blogspot.com/2009/11/easy-partials-in-rails.html">blog
  post by Mike Stone</a>.
</p>

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>
  <li> Allows easy partial invocation syntax, with simpler local variable
    passing </li>
  <li> Allows configurable shared directories for partials </li>
</ul>

<h2> Synopsis </h2>

<pre>
&lt;% _my_partial :var =&gt; "123" do %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Some block content.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The above would render a partial (as with <tt>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt;
"my_partial" %&gt;), with the local variable "var" set to "123", and the
local variable "body" set to the paragraph "some block content", HTML
tags included.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to use &lt;% rather than &lt;%=.
</p>

<p>
For a shared partial, use a line like the following in environment.rb
or in a file under initializers:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Easypartials.shared_directories = ["mydir1", "mydir2"]
</blockquote>

<p>
This will set up app/views/mydir1 and app/views/mydir2 as the
locations to look for partials when a directory isn't explicitly
given.
</p>

<p>
This plugin will first check the directory of the view being rendered,
then check the shared directories in the order given.
</p>


<h2> Requirements </h2>

<p>
You'll need a recent-ish version of Rails.  You'll also need hoe and
newgem, but you get them automatically when you install easypartials.
</p>

<h2> Installation </h2>

<p>
  <tt>sudo gem install easypartials</tt>
</p>
