Easypartials
============

EasyPartials are a way to make partials in Rails even easier!  This is
taken from a blog post by Mike Stone at
"http://smellsblue.blogspot.com/2009/11/easy-partials-in-rails.html".


Example
=======

<% _my_partial :var => "123" do %>
  <p>
    Some block content.
  </p>
<% end %>

The above would render a partial (as with <%= render :partial =>
"my_partial" %>), with the local variable "var" set to "123", and the
local variable "body" set to the paragraph "some block content", HTML
tags included.

Note that you need to use <% rather than <%=.
